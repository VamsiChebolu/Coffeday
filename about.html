<h1 align="left" style="color: #000000; font-size:36px;"><u>Journey of the Coffee Bean</u></h1><p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-size:18px;">If you asked us where the coffee beans that went into your cappuccino came from, we'd probably be able to tell you. The journey that the coffee in that perfect cup of yours has been on is worth writing about. The folks that work at our estates are a tenacious bunch. They will visit each coffee plant several times over the harvest season so that they pick the berry when it is just right: neither under-ripe nor over-ripe. The processed beans get carefully roasted, until we hear the second 'pop', which means they're ready.And then comes the grind. We are sure you know that the best coffee comes from freshly ground beans. That is why at a Cafe Coffee Day you'll hear the grinder go 'whirrr' for just 15-20 seconds for each shot of espresso. Finally, the last mile: the transformation of finely ground coffee into that perfect cuppa. There's a choice at that too.<br><br> At CD we shoot pressurized steam through the coffee to create a shot of espresso but you could get the same results using our handy stove-top espresso maker. Boiling water from the lower chamber shoots through coffee above it, and a heady decoction collects in the upper chamber; ready for the coffee connoisseur's drinking pleasure. For best results, take the stove off the heat before the coffee boils over. The French press is a more do-it-yourself approach complete with a plunger. Those who like their coffee thick and strong should take the plunger firmly in their hand, push it down and bring coffee grounds together with water in a unique blend. All roads that lead to that final ultimate objective: a great cup of coffee. From bean, to cup. Every time.</p>
